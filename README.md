# Miller Bot

Some simple Arma utils.

## Miller obeys these orders

### Config & Mod list
Miller will hold the current server configuration either in file and for example list of mods in SQLite database. You can of course configure where each file should be.

### Adding mods
Miller is able to insert mods into the DB in several ways, like adding 1 by 1, from Steam workshop list and of course from mod presets.

### Generating mod presets
Miller is able to generate mod preset for ArmaUnix and Official Arma launcher, allowing the admins to add mods and then simply let others download and apply the preset.

### CLI
Miller will listen to you through the CLI, meaning you can further automate stuff with scripts.

## Miller is booked on these trainings

### Discord Interface
Miller should be able to work as a Discord bot.

### Using AWS API to run servers
Miller will eventually be able to run AWS instance when necessary. Other than simply for playing, it can be used to quickly run the instance, download mods and then automatically shutdown.
